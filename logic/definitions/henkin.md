### Henkin Theory

A theory is called a **Henkin theory** if for every $\varphi(x_k)$ there exists a constant $c_\varphi$ such that:
$$T \vdash (\exists x_k.\varphi) \implies \varphi[c_\varphi / x_k]$$
i.e., it must prove that **if there exists** an $x$ such that $\varphi$, then that $x$ *has a name*.
