## Löwenheim-Skolem theorem $\uparrow$ weak form

1. Let $T$ be an $L$-theory. Suppose that for every $n \in \mathbb N$ there is a model of $T$ of cardinality $\geq n$. Then, for every cardinality $k$, there is a model of $T$ of cardinality $\geq k$.

2. Let $M$ be an infinite $L$-structure. Then, for every cardinality $k$, there is an elementary extension $N$ of $M$ having cardinality $\geq k$.
