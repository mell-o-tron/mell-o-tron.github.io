It suffices to extend the filter of cofinites. Let $U$ extend the filter of cofinites, if $U$ were principal generated by some $x \in I$ we would have $\{x \in U\}$. 

BUT we would also have $I \setminus \{x\} \in U$ because cofinite; hence:
$$\emptyset = (I \setminus\{x\}) \cap\{x\} \in U$$
which is a contradiction.
