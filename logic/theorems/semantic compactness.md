## Compactness Theorem - semantic version
Given an $L$-theory $T$ and an $L$-formula $\varphi$, if $T \models \varphi$ then there exists $T'$ a finite subset of $T$ such that $T'\models \varphi$.

### Consequence

If a theory is finitely consistent (all its finite subtheories are consistent), then it is consistent.
