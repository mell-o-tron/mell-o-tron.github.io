2024-04-15;Effect Handlers - Alessio Duè, Yuri Andriaccio (Room R1);Effect handlers have the potential to influence the design of the next 700 programming languages. <br><br> We'll be discovering what they are, why they are useful and how to implement them in a simple interpreter.<br><br>In the first part of the seminar, Alessio introduced the audiecnce to the topic of Effect Handlers. In the second part, Yuri implemented some of the examples that Alessio had earlier provided, using an interpreter of his own creation.; handlers.jpg
2024-04-18;Yoneda Lemma - Andrea Simone Costa (CTCC Seminar);Andrea's <em>"Category Theory and Cybernetic Culture"</em> exam seminar. The Yoneda Lemma tells us that: $$\text{Nat}(\text{Hom}(A, -), F) = FA$$ because some diagram commutes. You didn't get it? Neither have I.;yoneda.jpg
2024-04-22;Frog Computing - Matteo Simone (Room R1);Agent-based simulation of a complex system of frogs, inspired by our overlord Paolo Milazzo. <br><br>Matteo had some fun exterminating a population of frogs that lived in his computer, modeling a real life scenario. <br><br>Learn more about this <a href=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24750263.2023.2300284>here.</a>;frogs.jpg
2024-05-06;Coqshop - Lorenzo Pace & Alessio Duè (Room X7); Introduction to the Coq proof assistant. <br><br>In the first part of the encounter Lorenzo described the basics of the Coq proof assistant, and Alessio provided some examples. <br><br>After the seminar, the audience was provided with some simple theorems about the natural numbers, and they got to try out the proof assistant themselves. The first one to finish all the proofs was nominated Coqmaster.;coqshop.jpg
2024-06-20;From the search for the truth to symbolic calculus - Giuliano Gorgone (Room R1); Il seminario che vi presentiamo ha carattere divulgativo e si propone di gettare luce – e di stimolare una riflessione – sul profondo rapporto che lega filosofia, linguistica e informatica, inserendo quest’ultima nel florido contesto scientifico-culturale che l’ha generata. <br><br>Ripercorreremo insieme, anche con l'ausilio di esempi concreti, alcune tappe fondamentali del processo che culmina nella nascita e nello sviluppo dell’informatica, intesa sia nella sua dimensione pratica, sia nella sua dimensione teorica.Cercheremo altresì di tracciare un fil rouge tra le questioni fondazionali concernenti il tema del linguaggio e alcuni problemi tipici dell'informatica teorica. <br><br>Il nostro punto di partenza sarà rappresentato (ma non solo) dai contributi offerti dalle opere di Gottlob Frege, Leibniz e Cartesio.;gg.jpg
2024-07-15;Driftin' In Ghezzano - Lorenzo Pace (Mega Seminar, room X7); Implementation of macroscopic and microscopic traffic models, originally prepared for our overlord Paolo Milazzo's exam. <br><br>In the first part of the seminar, the audience was introduced to complex dynamical systems in general. Then, Lorenzo presented two models: one that describes the high level behaviour of a road network, and another that describes the single decisions of each vehicle in the network. <br><br>Finally, the models were visualized and compared through a Godot implementation.;mega.jpg
2024-07-15;Uta Stansburiana Sillycon Desert - Alessandro Scala, Salvatore Salerno (Mega Seminar, room X7); Alessandro and Salvatore describe an interesting "Rock-Paper-Scissors" behaviour in the reproduction of Uta Stansburiana lizards. <br><br>This seminar was also inspired by our overlord Paolo Milazzo's course on complex systems. <br><br> Learn more about the lizards <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-lizards-that-live-rock-paper-scissors-118219795/">here</a>.;mega.jpg
2024-07-15;Frog Checking - Matteo Simone (Mega Seminar, room X7); <h1>FROGS, AGAIN?!?</h1> Introduction to PRISM for the Statistical Model Checking of your favourite frog population. <br><br>At this point, people are starting to refer to our seminars as "the frog seminars", which I believe we are all very happy about.;mega.jpg
2024-07-15;Bare Metal Lambda-Calculus - Alessandro Scala, Lorenzo Pace (Mega Seminar, room X7); In this seminar, Alessandro and Lorenzo described their λ-Calculus compiler, that generates 16 bit x86 assembly. The compiler is integrated with BIOS, providing a way to write effectful low-level code using the $\lambda$-calculus.<br><br> The goal of the project was to imagine an alternative utopian 1990's reality, in which, to quote Alessandro, "object oriented programming lost the war".;mega.jpg
2024-10-22;Higher-Kinded Polymorphism in OCaml - Alessio Duè (Room M1, 14:00) ; The first seminar of the new season is about <b>Higher-Kinded Polymorphism in OCaml</b>. <br><br>Alessio will show us how to make poor man's typeclasses using some neat features of OCaml (GADTs, functors, extensible types)<br><br>The only prerequisite is some base OCaml or Haskell knowledge. It is not necessary to know what "higher-kinded polymorphism" means: it suffices to be interested in functional programming!;higher-kinded.jpg
