## Löwenheim-Skolem theorem $\uparrow$

1. Let $T$ be an $L$-theory. Suppose that for every $n \in \mathbb N$ there is a model of $T$ of cardinality $\geq n$. Then, for every cardinality $k \geq |L|$, there is a model of $T$ of cardinality $k$.

2. Let $M$ be an infinite $L$-structure. Then, for every infinite cardinality $k\geq|L|+|M|$, there is an elementary extension $N$ of $M$ having cardinality $k$.
