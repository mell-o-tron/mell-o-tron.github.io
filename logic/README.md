# Online Logic Handbook

This is a collection of definitions, theorems and proofs I compiled while taking a Mathematical Logic course when I was in uni.
If you find any grammatical (or mathematical!) oddities they might have been introduced when part of this website was semi-automatically translated from Italian to English.

**If you want to correct any of these or complete any of the incomplete proofs, feel free to contribute.**
